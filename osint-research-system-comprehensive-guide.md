## 1. Introduction

This comprehensive guide serves as the central reference for the OSINT Research System project. It is intended for all team members, including developers, testers, and the Product Owner. The document provides a holistic view of the project, detailed explanations of all components, and clear instructions for development and deployment.

## 2. Project Overview

The OSINT Research System is an advanced platform designed to leverage AI models and specialized research tools for efficient open-source intelligence gathering and analysis. The system aims to provide researchers with a powerful, user-friendly interface to conduct complex OSINT operations while maintaining high standards of data privacy and security.

Key Objectives:
- Integrate multiple AI models for diverse analysis capabilities
- Incorporate specialized OSINT tools for comprehensive data gathering
- Ensure scalability and performance for handling large-scale research tasks
- Maintain robust security measures to protect sensitive data
- Provide an intuitive user interface for researchers of varying technical backgrounds

## 3. System Architecture

Our system follows a modular, microservices-based architecture to ensure scalability and ease of maintenance. The main components are:

1. Frontend (React.js)
2. Backend API (FastAPI)
3. AI Model Integration Layer
4. Research Tools Integration Layer
5. Database (PostgreSQL)
6. Search Engine (Elasticsearch)
7. Authentication and Authorization Service
8. Task Queue and Background Workers (Celery with Redis)

[Insert the system architecture diagram here]

Detailed component interactions:
- The Frontend communicates with the Backend API via RESTful endpoints.
- The Backend API orchestrates requests between the frontend, AI models, and research tools.
- AI Model and Research Tools Integration Layers provide abstraction for easy addition or modification of capabilities.
- PostgreSQL stores structured data (user information, research requests, results).
- Elasticsearch enables efficient full-text search across research results.
- The Authentication service manages user sessions and access control.
- Celery workers handle long-running tasks asynchronously to maintain system responsiveness.

## 5. Development Guidelines

1. Code Style and Formatting:
   - Backend (Python): Follow PEP 8 guidelines. Use Black for automatic formatting.
   - Frontend (JavaScript/React): Use ESLint with Airbnb style guide. Use Prettier for formatting.

2. Git Workflow:
   - Use feature branches for all new developments.
   - Create pull requests for code reviews before merging into the main branch.
   - Write clear, concise commit messages describing the changes made.

3. Documentation:
   - Document all functions, classes, and modules using docstrings (backend) or JSDoc (frontend).
   - Keep README files and user documentation up-to-date with any changes.

4. Error Handling:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling in both frontend and backend.
   - Use custom exception classes for specific error scenarios.
   - Provide clear, user-friendly error messages.

5. Logging:
   - Use structured logging in the backend (e.g., using the `logging` module).
   - Implement different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) appropriately.
   - Ensure sensitive information is never logged.

6. Performance Considerations:
   - Use asynchronous programming techniques in the backend where appropriate.
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
   - Optimize database queries and use indexing effectively.

7. AI Model Integration:
   - Use the adapter pattern for integrating new AI models.
   - Implement robust error handling for AI model interactions.
   - Consider implementing a fallback mechanism if a primary AI model fails.

8. Research Tools Integration:
   - Create modular, pluggable integrations for each research tool.
   - Implement rate limiting and respect API usage guidelines for each tool.
   - Store API keys and sensitive credentials securely (use environment variables).

## 6. Deployment Instructions

1. Prerequisites:
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed on the host machine
   - Valid API keys for all integrated AI models and research tools

2. Configuration:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all required environment variables.
   - Update `docker-compose.yml` if any service-specific configurations need to be changed.
