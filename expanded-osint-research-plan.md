# Expanded OSINT Research System Plan

## System Architecture

1. AI Model Layer
   - Google AI (VertexAI)
   - Anthropic (Claude)
   - OpenAI (GPT-4)
   - Ollama (local server for open-source models)

2. Research Tools
   - Perplexity API (for complex queries)
   - Serper API (for general web searches)
   - NewsAPI (for news-specific searches)

3. CrewAI Framework
   - Custom agents with specialized tools
   - Task coordination and delegation

4. Data Processing and Storage
   - PostgreSQL database for structured data
   - Elasticsearch for full-text search and analytics

5. Backend API
   - FastAPI for efficient, async API endpoints

6. Frontend Dashboard
   - React.js for interactive UI
   - D3.js for data visualization

7. Docker Containerization
   - Separate containers for each component
   - Docker Compose for orchestration

8. Security and Anonymity
   - VPN integration for anonymized requests
   - Encryption for data at rest and in transit

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up development environment
   - Install Docker Desktop
   - Set up Python virtual environment

2. Create Docker containers
   - Base Python container
   - AI model containers (one for each provider)
   - Database containers (PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch)
   - Backend API container
   - Frontend container

3. Implement AI model interfaces
   - Create abstraction layer for unified API across models

4. Develop custom research tools
   - Implement wrappers for Perplexity, Serper, and NewsAPI
   - Create tool selection logic based on query complexity

5. Enhance CrewAI agents
   - Implement specialized agents with custom tools
   - Develop inter-agent communication protocols

6. Build backend API
   - Design RESTful endpoints for agent interactions and data retrieval
   - Implement authentication and rate limiting

7. Develop frontend dashboard
   - Create intuitive interface for launching research tasks
   - Implement real-time progress tracking and result visualization

8. Set up data processing pipeline
   - Implement ETL processes for cleaning and storing research data
   - Develop analytics queries for insights generation

9. Implement security measures
   - Set up VPN integration for anonymized requests
   - Implement encryption for sensitive data

10. Testing and refinement
    - Develop comprehensive test suite
    - Perform security audits
    - Optimize performance and resource usage

11. Documentation
    - Create technical documentation for system architecture
    - Develop user guides for researchers

12. Deployment
    - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
    - Prepare production environment
