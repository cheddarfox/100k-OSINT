## Introduction
[Same as before]

## Features
[Previous features, plus:]
- Redis caching for improved performance
- RabbitMQ for asynchronous task processing
- Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring
- Internationalization (i18n) support
- WCAG 2.1 compliant frontend

## System Architecture
[Insert the SVG diagram here]

Our system architecture consists of the following main components:
- Frontend: React.js application
- API Gateway: FastAPI server
- Backend Services: CrewAI and custom research tools
- Database: PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- Search Engine: Elasticsearch for efficient full-text search
- Cache: Redis for improved performance
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ for handling asynchronous tasks
- Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for real-time system monitoring

## Prerequisites
[Same as before, plus:]
- Redis
- RabbitMQ
- Prometheus
- Grafana

## Project Structure
[Update to include new files and directories]

## Setup Instructions
[Update to include setup for Redis, RabbitMQ, Prometheus, and Grafana]

## Usage
[Same as before]

## API Documentation
[Same as before]

## Development Guidelines
[Previous guidelines, plus:]
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow i18n best practices for internationalization
- Ensure all new frontend components are WCAG 2.1 compliant

## Testing
[Same as before]

## Deployment
[Update to include deployment considerations for new components]

## Security Considerations
[Previous considerations, plus:]
- Implement OAuth2 with JWT for authentication
- Add CSRF protection for form submissions
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing

## Performance Optimization

- Leverage RabbitMQ for handling increased workloads

## Monitoring and Logging
- Use Prometheus for collecting metrics
- Set up Grafana dashboards for visualizing system performance
- Implement comprehensive logging throughout the application

## Data Management
- Implement regular automated backups for PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch
- Create and maintain a disaster recovery plan
- Implement data retention policies in compliance with relevant regulations

## Internationalization
- Use i18n libraries for both frontend and backend
- Maintain language files for supported languages
- Implement language selection in the user interface

## Accessibility
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance for all frontend components
- Regularly audit the application for accessibility issues
- Provide accessibility documentation for users
