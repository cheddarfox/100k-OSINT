## Risk Assessment

1. Integration challenges with multiple AI models and tools
   Mitigation: Start with one model/tool and gradually add others, use abstraction layers

2. Performance issues with complex queries
   Mitigation: Implement caching, optimize database queries, consider asynchronous processing

3. Security vulnerabilities
   Mitigation: Regular security audits, stay updated on best practices, use security-focused libraries

4. Scalability concerns as data volume grows
   Mitigation: Design with scalability in mind, use efficient indexing, consider sharding strategies

5. User adoption and usability issues
   Mitigation: Involve end-users in testing, gather feedback early and often, iterate on UI/UX
