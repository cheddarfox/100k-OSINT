## II. User Stories for MVP

1. As an OSINT analyst, I want to visualize connections between entities so that I can quickly identify key relationships in my investigation.

2. As a researcher, I want to input natural language queries about complex relationships so that I can leverage the system's graph traversal capabilities without learning a query language.

3. As an investigator, I want the system to generate summary reports of its findings so that I can quickly brief my team on the results of a query.

4. As a data privacy officer, I want to ensure that sensitive information is properly anonymized so that we comply with data protection regulations.

5. As a senior analyst, I want to see the provenance of information in the knowledge graph so that I can assess the reliability of the system's outputs.
